        <p>At independence, the Ministry of Defence was referred to as the Ministry of Internal Security
            and Defence. The Ministry of Internal Security and Defence encompassed the military, police
            and prison. During this period, there were only 21 civilians spread over the Kenya Army, the
            Kenya Air Force, the Kenya Navy, the Kenya Police and Prisons.

            After independence in 1963, an Act of Parliament (KMF Act-Cap 198), created the Kenya
            Military Forces and the following year in 1964 Prisons and Police were transferred to the
            Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1966, the Police Department was further transferred from the
            Home Affairs docket to the Office of the President.

            In 1968 an Act of Parliament repealed Chapter 198 which had created the Kenya Military
            Forces and replaced it with Chapter 199 of the Laws of Kenya creating the Kenya Armed
            Forces. Defence remained as the Ministry of Defence until 1980.

            The Ministry has changed names since independence through Executive Orders of the President
            that spells out names of Ministryâ€™s. It has been referred to as:

            Internal Security and Defence (1963-1978)
            The Department of Defence (DoD) (1978-2000)
            The Ministry of Provincial Administration and National Security (2003-2005)
            The Ministry of State for Defence (2000-2003)
            The Ministry Of Defence (2006- current)</p>
